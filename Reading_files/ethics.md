# Ethics

Ethics is defined as moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity.
Ethics in tech can be a wide variety of things whether it be google and facebooks massive data harvesting from its users or that mostly all technology we use today some part has been made, or particarly mined, from conflict minerals, ie. mined by child slaves.
Ethics is a touchy subject for most but the fact is money makes the world go around, you will find, no matter what company that you look in, if you look hard enough, might be something you disagree with personally. For me personally i am against social media basically of any kind because of data harvesting and i honestly dont care what you had for breakfast or your feelings on subjects most of the time. Their is considered white hat hacking, ethicly hacking to find vunerabilities, and black hat hacking, for malicious activities. I dont believe in a strict protocol for ethics, after all most of these huge companies do questionable stuff all the time, *cough cough* foxconn. So as long as im getting a decent wage and they arent doing anything completly moraly wrong i will work for most any company, except facebook thats just unethical.
