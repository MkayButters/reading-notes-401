## Linked Lists

- A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

- Printing out all of the nodes in a Linked List is very similar to what we did in the Find() method. This is because we are leveraging our Current node and a while loop to traverse through the existing linked list.

- One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. 

- The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines:

    - When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory. 
    - Linked lists donâ€™t need to take up a single block of memory; instead, the memory that they use can be scattered throughout.

- A linked list can be small or huge, but no matter the size, the parts that make it up are actually fairly simple. A linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list.
