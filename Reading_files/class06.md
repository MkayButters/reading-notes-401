## Random Module

- We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc.


- __Randint__ if we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

- __Random__ If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

- The choice function can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.

- The __shuffle__ function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

## Risk Analysis

- The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

- Using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

_There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:_

1. Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

2. Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

3. Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

4. Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.
